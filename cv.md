#### **About Me:**

Being curious and thirsty for knowledge, I can’t stay away from learning something new. I have graduated from the Linguistic University but devoting my life only to human languages has never been my final aim. I started carrier at a large game-dev company as a localization specialist 4 years ago. Working with web development teams, I’ve realized that solving complicated tasks, working in teams, and turning unreadable codes into usable interfaces is something that makes me really excited. I’d like to learn and understand more in this area, and who knows what it can lead to.
